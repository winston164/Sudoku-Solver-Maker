One way to define a programming interface for a Sudoku game in Java is to use an object-oriented approach. You can define a `Sudoku` class that represents the game board, with the following methods:

1. `public Sudoku()` - A constructor that initializes the board to an empty state.

2. `public boolean set(int row, int col, int value)` - A method that sets the value of a cell in the board. It takes as input the row and column coordinates, as well as the value to be set, and returns `true` if the operation was successful, `false` otherwise (for example, if the cell is already filled or the value is not valid).

3. `public int get(int row, int col)` - A method that returns the value of a cell in the board. It takes as input the row and column coordinates, and returns the value (0 if the cell is empty).

4. `public boolean isComplete()` - A method that checks if the board is complete (all cells are filled with valid values).

5. `public boolean isValid()` - A method that checks if the board is valid (no duplicates in rows, columns or boxes, and all cells contain valid values).

6. `public void clear()` - A method that clears the board, setting all cells to 0.

With these methods, you can create a Sudoku game and manipulate it programmatically, setting and getting the values of the cells, checking if the game is complete or valid, and clearing the board when needed.

In addition to the `Sudoku` class, you may also want to define a separate class for handling the user interface (UI), such as a `SudokuUI` class. The UI class can use the methods of the `Sudoku` class to display the game board, handle user input, and update the board accordingly.
